The purpose of bringing up this file is because some error in SDAccel,
I am still not very sure about whether this problem is caused by bugs in SDAccel or my code (though I believe it the previous reason but no confirmation is made)

The phenomenon is describbed below:

1) SDAccel 2015.1.2 or below: compilation is fine, CPU emlation is fine;
2) SDAccel 2015.1.4 or higher version: compilation is fine but we met with segmentation fault with CPU emulation
3) the same executable file that is compiled by SDAccel 2015.1.2 can CPU emulate well in SDAccel 2015.1.5 environment
4) g++ compilation and execution finishes well;
5) valgrind memcheck pass
